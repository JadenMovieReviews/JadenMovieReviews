<p style="color:white;">People do all sorts of things during their spare time; Some go for a run, some read a book, some play video games. I, however, watch movies. But not just any movies. BAD movies.<br><br>I gravitate towards movies with horrible plots, CGI, acting, you name it. But I can only see the best parts of these motion pictures.<br><br>That leads me to the reason for the creation of this place: to share with you the wonders of my "career" and gallery. So without further ado, welcome to my humble blog.

<p>Summary:<br>Tony Bill provides the a prime example of how to spend a $60 million budget and end up with one hour of great action scenes and one hour of cliches and forced exposition you wish you could skip. The actors' talents are wasted with these simple characters and a script full of simple yet somewhat effective corny fights and subplots. The character development and backstories are extremely basic, but are pulled off by the amazing cast. It's not the greatest war movie every to grace theaters, but it has its merits.</p>
